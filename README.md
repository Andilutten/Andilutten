# Welcome Octonauts

My name is Andreas and I am a software developer based in Sweden. I currently lead developer at [ActiveQuiz Europe AB](https://activequiz.com) where I do
software development (both for web and mobile), devops and sysops, architecture and technical planning.

I mainly work professionaly with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [React](https://react.dev), but on my spare time I dabble alot with [Go](https://golang.org) which is
my prefered weapon of choice.

I am a strong advocate of [Docker](https://docker.com) and I love the world of Open-Source Software.

If you have any questions regarding me or my work, please do not hestitate to [email me](mailto://andreas.malmqvist@activequiz.com)

Kind Regards

Andreas Malmqvist
